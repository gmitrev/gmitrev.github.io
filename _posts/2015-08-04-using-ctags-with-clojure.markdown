Ctags (or Exuberant Ctags) is an amazing tool that creates an index with
language objects that makes it really easy and fast to locate single functions
or any other object (class, module, etc.).

It has support for multiple editors and programming languages but sadly Clojure
is not among them. This makes it a bit harder but not impossible to make them
work together.
