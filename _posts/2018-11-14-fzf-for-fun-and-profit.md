fzf is a command-line fuzzy finder that is amazingly useful and you will never be able to go back
to your cave days once you've seen its magic.

### What is it?

It's a fuzzy finder. You feed it a list of things and it lets you filter them.

### How can that be helpful?

The greatest thing about fzf is that it lets YOU choose how to (ab)use it. Tired of running `git
branch` and then `git checkout <TAB> <TAB>`?
