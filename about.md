My name is Georgi, I develop software for fun and profit and I live in Sofia, Bulgaria. I currently
work at [Receipt Bank](https://www.receipt-bank.com).

I am a serial side-project creator. Check out what I'm currently working on in the
[projects](/projects) page.

My favourite programming language is Ruby, which I use to build beautiful(?) applications that
bring joy(?) to billions and billions of users every day /s. Although I prefer the backend, I am
never affraid to get my hands dirty with some filthy js/css mess. My infra skills are also not too
bad.

I
[read great books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114198-georgi-mitrev),
[listen to too much heavy metal](https://www.last.fm/user/gosshedd) and
[take photos when I remember to take my camera with me](https://www.flickr.com/photos/152683660@N05/).
