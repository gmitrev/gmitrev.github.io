My name is Georgi, I develop software for fun and profit and I live in Sofia, Bulgaria. I currently
work at [Receipt Bank](https://www.receipt-bank.com).

My favourite language is Ruby, which I use everyday to build beautiful(?) applications that bring
joy(?) to billions and billions of users every day /s. Although I prefer the backend, I am never
affraid to get my hands dirty with some filthy js/css mess.
